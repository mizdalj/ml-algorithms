# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This project is an attempt to implement various machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python. This provides a
deeper understanding of the intricacies of each algorithm, apart from relying on pre-built libraries.

## Algorithms Implemented:

- âœ… Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Decision Trees
- [ ] Neural Networks

## Setting up the Project:

### 1. Set up a virtual environment:

For Linux/MacOS:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:

```shell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets:

World Population Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/world-population-data
Spam or Not Spam Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ozlerhakan/spam-or-not-spam-dataset

## Running the Algorithms:

Use the following command to run the algorithms:

```bash
python main.py
```
