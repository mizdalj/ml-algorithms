## Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This project is an attempt to implement various machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python. This provides a deeper understanding of the intricacies of each algorithm, apart from relying on pre-built libraries.

### Algorithms Implemented:
- [ ] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Decision Trees
- [ ] Neural Networks
- ... (add more algorithms as you implement them)

### Setting up the Project:

#### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd <your-repo-name>
```

#### 2. Set up a virtual environment:
For Linux/MacOS:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:
```
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Algorithms:
