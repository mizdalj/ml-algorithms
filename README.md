# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This project is an attempt to implement various machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python. This provides a deeper understanding of the intricacies of each algorithm, apart from relying on pre-built libraries.

## Algorithms Implemented:
- [ ] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Decision Trees
- [ ] Neural Networks

## Setting up the Project:

### 1. Set up a virtual environment:
For Linux/MacOS:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:
```
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets:
